Conceptnet-lite is a Python library for working with ConceptNet offline without the need for PostgreSQL.

The library comes with Apache License 2.0, and is separate from ConceptNet itself. The ConceptNet is available under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, which also applies to the formatted database file that we provide. See [here](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Copying-and-sharing-ConceptNet) for the list of conditions for using ConceptNet data.

This is the official citation for ConceptNet if you use it in research:

> Robyn Speer, Joshua Chin, and Catherine Havasi. 2017. "ConceptNet 5.5: An Open Multilingual Graph of General Knowledge." In proceedings of AAAI 31.

## Status

ConceptNet was not updated since September 2021, so Conceptnet-lite won't be updated either. Please do not use it in any new projects.

## Installation

To install `conceptnet-lite` use `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install conceptnet-lite
```

## Connecting to the database

Before you can use `conceptnet-lite`, you will need to obtain ConceptNet dabase file. You have two options: download pre-made one or build it yourself from the raw ConceptNet assertions file.

### Downloading the ConceptNet database 

ConceptNet releases happen once a year. You can use `conceptnet-lite` to build your own database from the raw assertions file (see below), but if there is a pre-built file it will be faster to just get that one. `conceptnet-lite` can download and unpack it to the specified folder automatically.

Here is a [link](https://conceptnet-lite.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/conceptnet.db.zip) to a compressed database for ConceptNet 5.7. This link is used automatically if you do not supply the alternative.

```python
import conceptnet_lite

conceptnet_lite.connect("/path/to/conceptnet.db")
```

This command both downloads the resource (our build for ConceptNet 5.7) and connects to the database. If path specified as the first argument does not exist, it will be created (unless there is a permissions problem). Note that the database file is quite large (over 9 Gb). 

If your internet connection is intermittent, the built-in download function may give you errors. If so, just download the file separately, unpack it to the directory of your choice and provide the path to the `.connect()` method as described below.

### Building the database for a new release.

If a database file is not found in the folder specified in the `db_path` argument, `conceptnet-lite` will attempt to automatically download the raw assertions file from [here](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Downloads) and build the database. This takes a couple of hours, so we recommend getting the pre-built file.

If you provide a path, this is where the database will be built. Note that the database file is quite large (over 9 Gb). Note that you need to pass `db_download_url=None` to force the library build the database from dump.

```python
import conceptnet_lite

conceptnet_lite.connect("/path/to/conceptnet.db", db_download_url=None)
```

If the specified does not exist, it will be created (unless there is a permissions problem). If no path is specified, and no database file is not found in the current working directory, `conceptnet-lite` will attempt to build one in the current working directory. 

Once the database is built, `conceptnet-lite` will connect to it automatically.

### Loading the ConceptNet database 

Once you have the database file, all you need to do is to pass the path to it to the `.connect()` method.

```python
import conceptnet_lite

conceptnet_lite.connect("/path/to/conceptnet.db")
```

If no path is specified, `conceptnet-lite` will check if a database file exists in the current working directory. If it is not found, it will trigger the process of downloading the pre-built database (see above).

## Accessing concepts

Concepts objects are created by looking for every entry that matches the input string exactly.
If none is found, the `peewee.DoesNotExist` exception will be raised.

```python
from conceptnet_lite import Label

cat_concepts = Label.get(text='cat').concepts  
for c in cat_concepts:
    print("    Concept URI:", c.uri)
    print("    Concept text:", c.text)
```
```console
Concept URI: /c/en/cat
Concept text: cat
Concept URI: /c/en/cat/n
Concept text: cat
Concept URI: /c/en/cat/n/wn/animal
Concept text: cat
Concept URI: /c/en/cat/n/wn/person
...
```

`concept.uri` provides access to ConceptNet URIs, as described [here](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/URI-hierarchy). You can also retrieve only the text of the entry by `concept.text`.

## Working with languages

You can limit the languages to search for matches. Label.get() takes an optional `language` attribute that is expected to be an instance `Language`, which in turn is created by calling `Language.get()` with `name` argument.
List of available languages and their codes are described [here](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Languages).

```python
from conceptnet_lite import Label

cat_concepts = Label.get(text='cat', language='en').concepts  
for c in cat_concepts:
    print("    Concept URI:", c.uri)
    print("    Concept text:", c.text)
    print("    Concept language:", c.language.name)
```

```console
    Concept URI: /c/en/cat
    Concept text: cat
    Concept language: en
    Concept URI: /c/en/cat/n
    Concept text: cat
    Concept language: en
    Concept URI: /c/en/cat/n/wn/animal
    Concept text: cat
    Concept language: en
    Concept URI: /c/en/cat/n/wn/person
    Concept text: cat
    Concept language: en
...
```


## Querying edges between concepts

To retrieve the set of relations between two concepts, you need to create the concept objects (optionally specifying the language as described above). `cn.edges_between()` method retrieves all edges between the specified concepts. You can access its URI and a number of attributes, as shown below.

Some ConceptNet relations are symmetrical: for example, the antonymy between *white* and *black* works both ways. Some relations are asymmetrical: e.g. the relation between *cat* and *mammal* is either hyponymy or hyperonymy, depending on the direction. The `two_way` argument lets you choose whether the query should be symmetrical or not.

```python
from conceptnet_lite import Label, edges_between

introvert_concepts = Label.get(text='introvert', language='en').concepts
extrovert_concepts = Label.get(text='extrovert', language='en').concepts
for e in edges_between(introvert_concepts, extrovert_concepts, two_way=False):
    print("  Edge URI:", e.uri)
    print("  Edge name:", e.relation.name)
    print("  Edge start node:", e.start.text)
    print("  Edge end node:", e.end.text)
    print("  Edge metadata:", e.etc)
```
```console
  Edge URI: /a/[/r/antonym/,/c/en/introvert/n/,/c/en/extrovert/]
  Edge name: antonym
  Edge start node: introvert
  Edge end node: extrovert
  Edge metadata: {'dataset': '/d/wiktionary/en', 'license': 'cc:by-sa/4.0', 'sources': [{'contributor': '/s/resource/wiktionary/en', 'process': '/s/process/wikiparsec/2'}, {'contributor': '/s/resource/wiktionary/fr', 'process': '/s/process/wikiparsec/2'}], 'weight': 2.0}
```

* **e.relation.name**: the name of ConceptNet relation. Full list [here](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Relations).

* **e.start.text, e.end.text**: the source and the target concepts in the edge

* **e.etc**: the ConceptNet [metadata](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Edges) dictionary contains the source dataset, sources, weight, and license. For example, the introvert:extrovert edge for English contains the following metadata:

```json
{
	"dataset": "/d/wiktionary/en",
	"license": "cc:by-sa/4.0",
	"sources": [{
		"contributor": "/s/resource/wiktionary/en",
		"process": "/s/process/wikiparsec/2"
	}, {
		"contributor": "/s/resource/wiktionary/fr",
		"process": "/s/process/wikiparsec/2"
	}],
	"weight": 2.0
}
```

## Accessing all relations for a given concepts

You can also retrieve all relations between a given concepts and all other concepts, with the same options as above:

```python
from conceptnet_lite import Label, edges_for

for e in edges_for(Label.get(text='introvert', language='en').concepts, same_language=True):
    print(e.start.text, "::", e.end.text, "|", e.relation.name)
```
```console
extrovert :: introvert | antonym
introvert :: extrovert | antonym
outrovert :: introvert | antonym
reflection :: introvert | at_location
introverse :: introvert | derived_from
introversible :: introvert | derived_from
introversion :: introvert | derived_from
introversion :: introvert | derived_from
introversive :: introvert | derived_from
introverted :: introvert | derived_from
...
```

The same set of edge attributes are available for `edges_between` and `edges_for` (e.uri, e.relation.name, e.start.text, e.end.text, e.etc).

Note that we have used optional argument `same_language=True`. By supplying this argument we make `edges_for` return
relations, both ends of which are in the same language. If this argument is skipped it is possible to get edges to
concepts in languages other than the source concepts language. For example, the same command as above with `same_language=False` will include the following in the output:

```console
kääntyä_sisäänpäin :: introvert | synonym
sulkeutua :: introvert | synonym
sulkeutunut :: introvert | synonym
introverti :: introvert | synonym
asociale :: introvert | synonym
introverso :: introvert | synonym
introvertito :: introvert | synonym
内向 :: introvert | synonym
```

## Accessing concept edges with a given relation direction

You can also query the relations that have a specific concept as target or source. This is achieved with `concept.edges_out` and `concept.edges_in`, as follows:

```python
from conceptnet_lite import Label

concepts = Label.get(text='introvert', language='en').concepts  
for c in concepts:
    print("    Concept text:", c.text)
    if c.edges_out:
        print("      Edges out:")
        for e in c.edges_out:
            print("        Edge URI:", e.uri)
            print("        Relation:", e.relation.name)
            print("        End:", e.end.text)
    if c.edges_in:
        print("      Edges in:")
        for e in c.edges_in:
            print("        Edge URI:", e.uri)
            print("        Relation:", e.relation.name)
            print("        End:", e.end.text)
```
```console
    Concept text: introvert
      Edges out:
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/etymologically_derived_from/,/c/en/introvert/,/c/la/introvertere/]
        Relation: etymologically_derived_from
        End: introvertere
...
      Edges in:
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/antonym/,/c/cs/extrovert/n/,/c/en/introvert/]
        Relation: antonym
        End: introvert
...
```

## Traversing all the data for a language

You can go over all concepts for a given language. For illustration, let us try Old Norse, a "small" language with the code "non" and vocab size of 7868, according to the [ConceptNet language statistics](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Languages).

```python
from conceptnet_lite import Language

mylanguage = Language.get(name='non')
for l in mylanguage.labels:
    print("  Label:", l.text)
    for c in l.concepts:
        print("    Concept URI:", c.uri)
        if c.edges_out:
            print("      Edges out:")
            for e in c.edges_out:
                print("        Edge URI:", e.uri)
        if c.edges_in:
            print("      Edges in:")
            for e in c.edges_in:
                print("        Edge URI:", e.uri)
```
```console
  Label: andsœlis
    Concept URI: /c/non/andsœlis/r
      Edges out:
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/antonym/,/c/non/andsœlis/r/,/c/non/réttsœlis/]
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/related_to/,/c/non/andsœlis/r/,/c/en/against/]
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/related_to/,/c/non/andsœlis/r/,/c/en/course/]
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/related_to/,/c/non/andsœlis/r/,/c/en/sun/]
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/related_to/,/c/non/andsœlis/r/,/c/en/widdershins/]
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/synonym/,/c/non/andsœlis/r/,/c/non/rangsœlis/]
    Concept URI: /c/non/andsœlis
      Edges out:
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/external_url/,/c/non/andsœlis/,/c/en.wiktionary.org/wiki/andsœlis/]
  Label: réttsœlis
    Concept URI: /c/non/réttsœlis
      Edges in:
        Edge URI: /a/[/r/antonym/,/c/non/andsœlis/r/,/c/non/réttsœlis/]
...
```

## Accessing Concepts by URI

You can access concept ORM objects directly by providing a desired ConceptNet URI. This is done as follows:

```python
from conceptnet_lite import Concept

edge_object = Edge.get(start='/c/en/example')
concept_object = Concept.get(uri='/c/en/example')
```
